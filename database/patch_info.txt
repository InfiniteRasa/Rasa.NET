If you have to change something in the database, you'll have to apply the changes to the full database structure in the full folder and create a patch representing that change in the patches folder.

Patches must be named the following way:
<date>_<hour>_<short_description>.sql

For example:
20180701_170000_add_applied_patches_table.sql

These names can't be longer than 128 characters!

At the end of every patch, there must be an INSERT statement that inserts the current patch to the applied_patches table, so the user can keep track of what patches was applied.
For example:
INSERT INTO `applied_patches` (`patch_name`) VALUE ('20180701_170000_add_applied_patches_table');

In the full database script, you must add the INSERT statement too, so if someone applies the full database at any given time, the current applied patches will be known.

The patch_name must match the file name WITHOUT the extension.
The apply_time column can be skipped, as it's default value on insertion is the current timestamp.

Every once in a while the patches will be deleted when there are too many. In this case, the user can go back to the commit that deletes the patches and fast-forward the database with those patches until the point where new patches are available.
