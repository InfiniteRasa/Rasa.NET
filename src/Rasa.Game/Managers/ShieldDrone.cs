    ///    and Virulent weapons do no damage to these machines."

    ///    to blast the devices."
    ///
    /// SHIELD_DRONE_SHIELD_SOURCE (229) sits on the drone. Its client class carries
    /// Recv_ReflectDamage and a DAMAGE_REFLECTION_SPEED of 45, so the server names who is being
    /// reflected at and the client flies the hit there itself and floats the damage on arrival.
    /// SHIELD_DRONE_SHIELD (230) sits on the Bane inside, and its class says exactly how the
    /// counterplay works: it "reduces non-EMP damage to friendlies inside a Shield Drone's
    /// shield. Damage from enemies who are also inside the shield is ignored." Getting under the
    /// shield is what turns both halves off, which is what the guide tells the player to do.
