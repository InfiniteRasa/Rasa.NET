    ///     wait for the server to start the windup.

    ///     (ActorManager.RefuseRequest: UserActionFailed, which the client shows, and
    ///     ActionFailed, which cancels its windup). Otherwise everyone else is
    ///     sent PerformWindup so they see the animation, and the action is queued for the
    ///     windup time.

    ///     cooldown, applies the effect, and sends PerformRecovery with the list of who was hit
