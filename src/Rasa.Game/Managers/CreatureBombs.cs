    /// The creature attacks that explode, from their client classes:
    ///
    ///  - Death blast (WardenBotDeathAbility, CR_WARDEN_BOT_DEATH 480): when the Warden dies, a
    ///    recovery of the action listing every player within RADIUS_AROUND_SOURCE with its damage,
    ///    as the bare rawInfo the class's DoAbility reads - the shape of a crab mine's
    ///    CR_CRAB_MINE_DEATH, which the class is a copy of.
    ///  - Death bomb (HowlerDeathAbility 514, PredatorDeathAbility 407): a BombEffect on the dying
    ///    creature - HOWLER_DEATH, PREDATOR_DEATH_EXPLOSION - that goes off DELAY_TIME_MS later
    ///    (the Howler at once, the Predator 3 s on): CallGameEffectMethod DoExplosion(damageData),
    ///    which plays the blast where the creature lies and floats every (entityId, rawInfo) in it.
    ///    The Predator's class names the effect as its targetGameEffect on TARGET_SELF, so a
    ///    recovery listing the Predator itself announces it; the Howler's names none, so its
    ///    effect is announced as it attaches. HowlerDeathEffect has removeTarget: the client takes
    ///    the Howler away when it goes off - there is no corpse to loot.
    ///  - Self-destruct (FithikSelfDestructAbility 180): a Fithik brought down to
    ///    SelfDestructHealthPercent of its health stops, winds up (4.3 s, the client's own
    ///    animation), and blows up: a recovery of the action with every player within
    ///    RADIUS_AROUND_SOURCE, bare rawInfo, and the Fithik dies of it, the kill its target's. One
    ///    killed during the windup does not go off. When to do it is ours: the data has the blast,
    ///    not the reason.
    ///  - Ground blast (LinkerGroundBlastAbility 264): a Linker's attack is a bomb on its target -
    ///    LINKER_GROUND_BLAST, the class's targetGameEffect, announced by the attack's recovery -
    ///    going off at once on everyone within EFFECT_RADIUS of that player
    ///    (CreatureEffectAttacks puts it on; the attack itself does no damage).
    ///  - Egg (StalkerOvulateAbility 441, StalkerEggDropAbility 442): a Stalker ovulates -
    ///    STALKER_EGG_CHARGE 304 on itself, the class's sourceGameEffect, for EFFECT_DURATION_MS
    ///    (20 s), every EFFECT_INTERVAL_MS (2 s) burning every player within EFFECT_RADIUS (20 m)
    ///    for the ovulate row's damage, the tick StalkerEggChargeEffect.OnTick floats - and when
    ///    the charge is done it drops the egg: its windup (3.7 s, standing still), then
    ///    STALKER_EGG_DROP_EXPLOSION 305 on itself going off DELAY_TIME_MS later on every player
    ///    within the drop's EFFECT_RADIUS (60 m) for the egg row's damage, EMP, knocking them
    ///    KNOCKBACK_DISTANCE (10 m) back. One killed before the egg drops does not drop it. When
    ///    to ovulate is ours: in a fight, with a player in reach, not already charging.
    ///  - Missile (PredatorMissileAbility 426): the same on the player a Predator's missile hits -
    ///    PREDATOR_MISSILE_EXPLOSION, a BombEffect whose removeTarget is off, the class's
    ///    targetGameEffect - going off at once within EFFECT_RADIUS (10 m).
    ///  - Necromite (NecromiteSelfDestructAbility 489, "Causes a Necromite to self-destruct and
    ///    damage nearby hostiles"): the same on the player a Necromite reaches -
    ///    NECROMITE_SELF_DESTRUCT 382, "AoE dmg when a necromite blows up on a player", the
    ///    class's targetGameEffect - going off DELAY_TIME_MS (0.5 s) on within EFFECT_RADIUS
    ///    (5 m). The Necromite is spent on it (Spend): it dies as its bomb goes on, the kill its
    ///    target's, as a Fithik's self-destruct is. A Necromite blows up on whatever it is
    ///    fighting - a player, or a creature (a Forean, an AFS turret) - and its blast takes
    ///    everything around that it may fight, players and creatures (HitsCreatures).
    ///  - Corpse (NecromiteCorpseExplosionAbility 490, "Causes a Necromite to explode on a
    ///    corpse", canTargetDead): a Necromite in a fight with a creature's body within its reach
    ///    (the argument's range, 5 m) and a player it may fight within EFFECT_RADIUS (10 m) of
    ///    that body winds up at it (0.8 s), and NECROMITE_CORPSE_EXPLOSION 380 - the class's
    ///    targetGameEffect, "AoE dmg when a necromite blows up a corpse" - goes on the body,
    ///    going off DELAY seconds (2) later on every player within EFFECT_RADIUS of it. The body
    ///    is claimed from the moment the Necromite winds up at it (IsCorpseClaimed): no revive,
    ///    no Reanimation, Cadaver Immolation or Hortimonculus, no second Necromite. The client's
    ///    BombEffect takes the body away when it goes off (removeTarget), and the server gives it
    ///    up for despawn then, as Cadaver Immolation's. As there, the effect is sent to the
    ///    clients directly: the effect worker clears everything off a dead actor. A body
    ///    destroyed by a finishing move, a scripted object or one the client has taken away (a
    ///    Howler's) is not a body to use. The Necromite is not spent on a corpse.
