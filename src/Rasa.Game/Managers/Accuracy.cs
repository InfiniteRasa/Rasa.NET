    /// The aiming bead, kept on the server the way the client keeps it, so that the server knows
    /// when a shot was fired at full bead. The client never says: RequestWeaponAttack carries the
    /// action, its argument and the target, and the bead lives only in the client's
    /// Manifestation.UpdateAccuracy (client/augmentations/manifestation.py). This is that code,
    /// with the same constants from shared/gameconstants.py:
    ///
    ///  - accuracy runs from 0 to 100; the bead is full above 99 ("accuracyRatio > 0.99" in
    ///    reticlewindow.py, which is what shows the full-bead reticle);
    ///  - it climbs towards a ceiling at the weapon's aim rate per millisecond, twice that while
    ///    crouched (CROUCHED_ACCURACY_MOD 2.0), and falls at ACCURACY_LOSS_RATE (50 a second) when
    ///    it is above the ceiling;
    ///  - the ceiling is 100 crouched (CROUCHED_ACCURACY_MAX) and 80 standing still or walking
    ///    (STOPPED / SLOW_ACCURACY_MAX), 64 running (FAST_ACCURACY_MAX);
    ///  - each shot takes the weapon's recoil amount off it (baseweaponattack.py LocalDoAction);
    ///  - drawing a weapon starts it from 0 (actor.py, on an equipment update with a weapon);
    ///  - with no target the ceiling is 0 (UpdateAccuracyRates: "if self.GetTargetId() is None:
    ///    self.accuracyMaxValue = 0"), so the bead runs down, and starts building when a target
    ///    is picked - "Beading begins as soon as you target an enemy" (the strategy guide).
    ///
    /// The bead also sets the damage of a shot. The guide: "Failing to allow any bead time
    /// reduces the damage your attack delivers by a whopping 90% due to poor aim. Attacks with
    /// partial beading deliver greater damage, even if you can't afford to wait for a perfect
    /// shot." So a shot does NoBeadDamage of its damage at no bead, rising in a straight line to
    /// all of it at a full bead of 100 - the bead itself, not its share of the stance's ceiling.
    /// That is the reticle: its lines sit at accuracy / 100 of the way in (reticlewindow.py,
    /// Manifestation.accuracyRatio), and "the amount of damage your gun will do increases the
    /// closer these lines get to the center of the targeting reticule". Standing, they stop at 80
    /// and the shot does 82%; crouched they reach the centre and it does all of it - "Crouching
    /// increases your damage but also makes you easier to hit unless you are behind cover", and
    /// gets there twice as fast. Only a crouched shot is a full-bead shot, with its crit. The
    /// straight line is ours; the guide gives the two ends.
    ///
    /// The rates are worked out again whenever what they depend on changes - crouching, the
    /// target, the weapon - as UpdateAccuracyRates is on the client. Running is not told apart
    /// from walking: only crouching lifts the ceiling past 99, so whether a standing player could
    /// have reached 80 or only 64 never decides whether a shot was at full bead.
    ///
    /// The aim rate and recoil come from the weapon template, which is also what the client is
    /// sent in WeaponInfo, so both ends run the same bead. The aim rates are the guide's
    /// comparative bead times by weapon family (Retune_weapon_bead); recoil is still the shipped
    /// placeholder, 1.
