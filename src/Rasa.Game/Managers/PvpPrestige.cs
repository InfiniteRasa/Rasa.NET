    /// WARGAME_STEAL_PRESTIGE; a duel and a squad wargame have neither. The client's help says the
    /// same: prestige comes from "killing a player your clan is at war with".
    ///
    /// The numbers are gameconstants.py's, which the client itself never reads:

    ///    MIN / MAX_GENERATED_PRESTIGE_POINT = 10 / 50;
    ///  - BASE_STOLEN_PRESTIGE_PERCENTAGE = 1, STOLEN_PRESTIGE_PERCENTAGE_LEVEL_MODIFIER = 0.1,
    ///    MIN / MAX_STOLEN_PRESTIGE_PERCENTAGE = 0 / 2;
    ///  - KILL_CREDIT_PRESTIGE_LEVEL_MAX_ABOVE = 4, KILL_CREDIT_PRESTIGE_LEVEL_MAX_BELOW = 8;
    ///  - GENERATED_PRESTIGE_MIN_INTERVAL = 600 s, MAX_PVP_KILL_RECORD_KEEPING_TIME = 900 s.
    ///
    /// What the kill says is the client's too: the killer reads PM_PRESTIGE_POINTS_RECEIVED_PVPKILL
    /// ("You received %(amount)s prestige points for killing player %(playerName)s
    /// (%(amountGenerated)s points generated and %(amountStolen)s stolen from them)"), the victim
    /// PM_PRESTIGE_POINTS_REMOVED_PVPDEATH, and UpdateCredits floats "+N Prestige" over the killer.
    ///
    /// Ours, since only the constants' names say how they go together:
    ///  - the level difference is the victim's level less the killer's: a kill generates the base
    ///    plus the modifier a level of it, between the minimum and the maximum, and steals the base
    ///    percentage plus its modifier a level of it, between its minimum and maximum, of the
    ///    prestige the victim holds, rounded down;
    ///  - a kill has credit while the killer is no more than MAX_ABOVE levels above the victim and
    ///    no more than MAX_BELOW below them. Outside that it gives no prestige and does not count
    ///    for the feud (ClanFeuds.Kill, PM_WARGAME_FEUD_NO_KILL_CREDIT_LEVELS);
    ///  - the same killer generates prestige from the same victim once in the minimum interval;
    ///    what is stolen is taken every time, being the victim's own. Kills are remembered for the
    ///    record keeping time;
    ///  - the prestige is the killer's alone, whoever else was in the fight, and a creature's
    ///    kill is its master's;
    ///  - winning a feud is worth <see cref="FeudVictoryPrestige"/> to each member of the winning
    ///    clan in the world when it ends: nothing, until a value is chosen;
    ///  - the killer's wagered item (WARGAME_ITEM_WAGERING, InventoryManager.Wager) adds its
    ///    quality's percent - 20, 35 or 50 - to what the kill generates, rounded down, and so may
    ///    take it past the maximum. Nothing is added to what is stolen: that is the victim's own
    ///    prestige changing hands, and a bonus on it would be prestige made from nothing at every
    ///    kill, with no interval to hold it back. The bonus is counted as generated in the
